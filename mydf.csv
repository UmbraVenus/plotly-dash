Research\n\nStartup\nMy Skills and Values\n\nMy Purpose Guides to this Portfolio\nResume\n\nContact Information\nArt and Technology Education\n\nAwards & Achievements\n\nSkills\n\n| am passionate about art and technology. | was denied the opportunity to become an artist by my father, with\n\nhim quoting the “starving artist” phenomenon when | was 14 years old. Ever since then, | am determined to /\nsolve this issue so that no future generation would be denied their artistic dream purely because of monetary Experience\nproblems. With the advancement of computer vision, extended reality, and machine learning, alongside time\nand experience, | firmly believe that such a solution to the “starving artist” lies in the intersection of art and\n\ntechnology.\n\nResearch\n\nInnovation must happen for the problem of “starving artists” to disappear. There is a reason why such a\nphenomenon exists for most artists, and without some form of breakthrough, such bleak reality will continue\nto exist. | want to devote myself to the research of such innovation, be it computer vision, extended reality, or\nartificial intelligence. With hard work and resilience, | will contribute to such innovation.\n\nStartup\n\nDuring my leave from Berkeley, | tried my hands at founding my own startup. | interviewed about 200 artists,\nasking them what's their biggest issue and how can | help. The most common ones | get are the following:\n1.Piracy Issue 2.Connection with other artists 3.Monetary Issue | plan to use my knowledge from research to\ncontinue to explore and help to solve these problems and more.\n\nMy Skills and Values\n\nPython, C++, Swift, Web Development, iOS development, knowledge of startup, knowledge of art\n\nGuides to this Portfolio\n\nText to Music And Art Generator\n\nWhere the user inputs a keyword, and then we use table manipulation as well as search from API to generate\nart and music.\n\nhttps://mayaks1.github.io/\n\n \n\nYour Photo to AR (an iOS app)\n\nA simple AR app that lets you see your photo in an AR setting.\n\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/your-photo-in-ar/id1578206631\n\nDaily Art Recommendation\n\nWhere the page automatically pulls the daily recommended artwork from API in real-time, then the user can\n\nhttps://umbravenus.github.io/mynewbook/intro.html\n\x0c"", '8/5/2021\n\nClass\nCOMPSCI 61A\n\nMATH 1A\nTHEATER R1A\nUGBA 10\n\nSpring 2014\nClass\n\nART 8\nCOMPSCI 61AS\n\nCOMPSCI 61B\nMATH 1B\nPHYSICS 7A\n\nSpring 2021\nClass\n\nART 13\nCOMPSCI 88\nCOMPSCI 197\nDATA C8\nDATA 198\n\nSummer 2021\n\nClass\n\nDIGHUM 100 (Session\nA)\n\nDIGHUM\n150A (Session D)\n\nHISTORY\n137AC (Session D)\n\nFall 2021\n\nClass\nDATA C100\n\nHUM 105\n\nAcademic Summary | CalCentral\n\nTitle\n\nThe Structure and Interpretation of Computer\nPrograms\n\nCalculus\nPerformance: Writing and Research\n\nPrinciples of Business\n\nTitle\nIntroduction to Visual Thinking\n\nThe Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs\n(Self-Paced)\n\nData Structures\nCalculus\n\nPhysics for Scientists and Engineers\n\nTitle\n\nPainting: Foundations\n\nComputational Structures in Data Science\nField Study\n\nFoundations of Data Science\n\nDirected Group Studies for Advanced Undergraduates\n\nTitle\nTheory and Method in the Digital Humanities\n\nDigital Humanities and Archival Design\n\nImmigrants and Immigration as U.S. History\n\nTitle\n\nPrinciples & Techniques of Data Science\n\nArts Entrepreneurship\n\nhttps://calcentral.berkeley.edu/academics/academic_summary\n\nUn.\n\nGr.\n\nGr.\n\nUU > UD > >\n\nGr.\n\nGr.\n\nPts.\n0.0\n\n10.8\n0.0\n\nPts.\n16\n\n6.8\n\nPts.\n16\n\n12\n0.0\n16\n0.0\n\nPts.\n12\n\nPts.\n\n2/3\n\x0c', '8/5/2021 Academic Summary | CalCentral\n\nClass Title Un.
